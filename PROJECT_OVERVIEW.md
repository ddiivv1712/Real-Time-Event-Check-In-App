# Real-Time Event Check-In App - Project Overview

## 🎯 Project Summary

This is a complete full-stack React Native application that demonstrates:
- GraphQL API design with Apollo Server
- Real-time communication using Socket.io
- State management with Zustand and TanStack Query
- TypeScript implementation across the entire stack
- Database modeling with PostgreSQL and Prisma

## ✅ All Requirements Met

### Backend (Node.js + GraphQL + Prisma + Socket.io)
- ✅ GraphQL API with Apollo Server
- ✅ Query `events`: Get all available events with attendees
- ✅ Query `me`: Return user by email (auto-creates if doesn't exist)
- ✅ Mutation `joinEvent`: Join an event
- ✅ **Bonus**: Mutation `leaveEvent`: Leave an event
- ✅ Prisma integration with PostgreSQL
- ✅ Mock authentication (email-based)
- ✅ Socket.io real-time updates for:
  - User joins event (`userJoined`)
  - User leaves event (`userLeft`)
  - General event updates (`eventUpdated`)

### Frontend (React Native + Expo)
- ✅ Simple login screen (accepts any email/name)
- ✅ Event List Page with TanStack Query
- ✅ Event Detail Page with join/leave functionality
- ✅ Real-time attendee list using Socket.io
- ✅ Zustand for local state management
- ✅ Full TypeScript implementation

### Database Schema (Prisma)
- ✅ User model with id, name, email
- ✅ Event model with id, name, location, startTime
- ✅ Many-to-many relationship between User and Event

## 🏗 Architecture Highlights

### Real-time Implementation
- Socket.io rooms for event-specific updates
- Automatic real-time updates when users join/leave
- Clean separation between real-time and REST data

### State Management
- **Zustand**: Local authentication state
- **TanStack Query**: Server state caching and synchronization
- **Apollo Client**: GraphQL mutations and caching

### Type Safety
- Shared TypeScript interfaces between frontend and backend
- Full type coverage for API endpoints
- Type-safe Socket.io event handling

## 🚀 Features Implemented

### Core Features
- [x] User authentication (mock system)
- [x] View list of events
- [x] Join events
- [x] Real-time attendee updates
- [x] View event details
- [x] TypeScript throughout

### Bonus Features
- [x] Leave event functionality
- [x] User avatars (initials)
- [x] Real-time participant count
- [x] Clean UI with proper styling
- [x] Pull-to-refresh functionality
- [x] Error handling with user-friendly messages
- [x] Loading states for all operations

## 📱 User Experience Flow

1. **Login**: Enter email and name (creates user if doesn't exist)
2. **Event List**: See all events with attendee counts and join status
3. **Event Details**: Tap event to see details and attendee list
4. **Join/Leave**: Join or leave events with confirmation
5. **Real-time**: See live updates when others join/leave
6. **Refresh**: Pull down to refresh data

## 🧪 Testing the App

### Backend Testing
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run db:setup  # Sets up database and seeds data
npm run dev       # Starts server on port 4000
```

### Frontend Testing
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
expo start        # Starts Expo development server
```

### Real-time Testing
1. Open app on multiple simulators/devices
2. Log in with different emails
3. Join/leave same events
4. Watch real-time updates across all instances

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Backend Stack
- **Node.js + TypeScript**
- **Apollo Server** for GraphQL
- **Prisma** for database ORM
- **Socket.io** for real-time communication
- **PostgreSQL** for data persistence

### Frontend Stack
- **React Native + Expo**
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **React Navigation** for navigation
- **TanStack Query** for server state
- **Zustand** for local state
- **Apollo Client** for GraphQL
- **Socket.io Client** for real-time updates

### Database Design
- **Users**: Store user information
- **Events**: Store event details
- **Many-to-many**: Users can attend multiple events

## 📊 Code Quality

- ✅ Clean, modular code structure
- ✅ Proper error handling
- ✅ TypeScript for type safety
- ✅ Consistent naming conventions
